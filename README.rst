Cutnorm Approximation via Gaussian Rounding and Optimization with Orthogonality Constraints
===================================

This package computes the approximations to the cutnorm using some of the techniques detailed by Alon and Noar [ALON2004]_ and a fast optimization algorithm by Wen and Yin [WEN2013]_.
