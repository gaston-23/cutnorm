* Updating new version
- Setup.py, docs/source/conf.py
* Development Branch
- Work on develop branch before merging to master
- Clone a repo for master and merge the branch then push
* Generating new docs
- If new files are added, check the .rst files for autogen. For an example if you add a new module in cutnorm.tools, add another section to cutnorm.tools.rst
- Goto docs and "make html" this will generate html in the cutnorm_package_docs directory
- "make latexpdf" will generate manual in the package main directory
- Go to cutnorm_package_docs/html and git add . and git commit and push to gh-pages
* Updating PyPi
- Make sure new versions are setup
- python setup.py sdist upload
